## 5. DETAILED CALCULATION INSTRUCTIONS

### 5.1 Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio Calculations

#### 5.1.1 Front-End DTI (Housing Ratio)
**Formula:** (Total Monthly Housing Payment ÷ Gross Monthly Income) × 100

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**
1. Calculate Total Monthly Housing Payment (PITI):
   - Principal & Interest: Use loan amortization calculator
   - Property Taxes: Annual taxes ÷ 12
   - Homeowners Insurance: Annual premium ÷ 12
   - HOA Fees (if applicable): Monthly amount
   - PMI (if LTV > 80%): Use PMI rate table

**Example:**
```
Loan Amount: $450,000 at 6.5% for 30 years
P&I: $2,844.08
Property Taxes: $500/month ($6,000 annual)
Insurance: $150/month ($1,800 annual)
HOA: $200/month
Total PITI: $3,694.08

Gross Monthly Income: $7,916.67 ($95,000 annual)
Front-End DTI: ($3,694.08 ÷ $7,916.67) × 100 = 46.7%
```

#### 5.1.2 Back-End DTI (Total Debt Ratio)
**Formula:** (Total Monthly Debt Obligations ÷ Gross Monthly Income) × 100

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**
1. Sum ALL monthly debt obligations:
   - Housing payment (PITI)
   - Auto loans
   - Student loans
   - Credit card minimum payments
   - Other loans
   - Child support/alimony

2. Special Calculations:
   - **Credit Cards:** Use greater of: actual payment or 2% of balance
   - **Student Loans:** Use actual payment or 0.5% of balance if deferred
   - **Installment Loans:** Use actual monthly payment
   - **Revolving Debt:** Use minimum payment shown on credit report

**Example:**
```
Total PITI: $3,694.08
Auto Loan: $450
Student Loan: $350
Credit Cards (min): $200
Total Monthly Debt: $4,694.08

Back-End DTI: ($4,694.08 ÷ $7,916.67) × 100 = 59.3%
```

### 5.2 Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio Calculation

**Formula:** (Loan Amount ÷ Property Value) × 100

**Instructions:**
1. Determine property value:
   - Purchase: Use LESSER of purchase price or appraised value
   - Refinance: Use current appraised value
   
2. Calculate for all liens:
   - First Mortgage LTV: First mortgage ÷ Property value
   - Combined LTV (CLTV): All mortgages ÷ Property value

**Example:**
```
Property Value: $500,000 (appraised)
First Mortgage: $450,000
LTV: ($450,000 ÷ $500,000) × 100 = 90%

If Second Mortgage: $25,000
CLTV: ($475,000 ÷ $500,000) × 100 = 95%
```

### 5.3 Income Calculation Guidelines

#### 5.3.1 W-2 Employee Income
**Base Salary:**
1. Obtain 2 most recent pay stubs
2. Verify YTD earnings match frequency
3. Calculate: (YTD Earnings ÷ Months Worked) × 12
4. Compare to prior 2 years W-2s
5. Use LOWER of current run rate or 2-year average

**Overtime/Bonus:**
- Requires 2-year history
- Calculate 2-year average
- If declining, use lower amount or exclude
- Must be likely to continue

**Commission:**
- Requires 2-year history
- If >25% of income, treat as self-employed
- Use 2-year average (or less if declining)

#### 5.3.2 Self-Employed Income
**Required Documents:**
- 2 years personal tax returns (1040)
- 2 years business tax returns (if applicable)
- YTD P&L and Balance Sheet
- Business bank statements

**Calculation Method:**
1. Start with Schedule C net income (or K-1)
2. Add back:
   - Depreciation
   - Depletion
   - One-time expenses
   - Home office expenses (if buying new home)
3. Subtract:
   - Meals & entertainment
   - Business use of vehicle (if also claimed personally)
4. Average over 2 years
5. If declining >20%, use current year only

**Example:**
```
Year 1 Schedule C: $85,000
+ Depreciation: $12,000
- Meals (50%): $2,000
Adjusted Year 1: $95,000

Year 2 Schedule C: $92,000
+ Depreciation: $15,000
- Meals (50%): $2,500
Adjusted Year 2: $104,500

2-Year Average: $99,750
Monthly Income: $8,312.50
```

### 5.4 Asset Calculation and Verification

#### 5.4.1 Liquid Assets
**Acceptable Sources:**
- Checking/Savings accounts
- Money Market accounts
- CDs (without penalty)
- Stocks/Bonds (70% of value)
- Retirement accounts (60% of vested balance if <59.5 years)

**Large Deposit Definition:** 
- >50% of monthly income = requires explanation
- >$5,000 = automatic review trigger

#### 5.4.2 Required Reserves Calculation
**Formula:** Number of months × PITI payment

**Requirements by Property Type:**
- Primary Residence: 2 months (0 if LTV <80%)
- Second Home: 4 months
- Investment Property: 6 months
- Multiple Properties: Add 2 months per additional

## 7. STEP-BY-STEP DECISION PROCESS

### Step 1: Initial Document Review (5-10 minutes)

**Required Actions:**
1. **Open loan file in system**
   - Verify loan number matches application
   - Check for duplicate applications

2. **Document Checklist - Mark each as received:**
   - [ ] Completed 1003 application (all fields complete)
   - [ ] Credit authorization (signed and dated)
   - [ ] Government ID (unexpired)
   - [ ] 2 years W-2s or tax returns
   - [ ] 30 days pay stubs

   - Verify income figures match documentation
   - Check property address is complete

**RED FLAGS requiring immediate escalation:**
- Inconsistent SSN
- Income doesn't match stated
- Missing pages from statements

### Step 2: Credit Analysis (10-15 minutes)

**Detailed Review Process:**

1. **Pull Tri-Merge Credit Report**
   - Use all three bureaus (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion)
   - Use middle score for qualifying
   - If only two scores, use lower

2. **Credit Score Analysis:**
   ```
   Score Range    Action Required
   740+          Proceed normally
   680-739       Note compensating factors
   620-679       Requires additional review
   <620          Check for errors, likely denial
   ```

3. **Payment History Review:**
   - Count late payments by category:
     - 30 days late: Minor impact if <3 in 24 months
     - 60 days late: Major impact, require explanation
     - 90+ days late: Significant concern
   - Review collections/charge-offs:
     - Medical collections <$500: May ignore
     - All others: Require explanation

4. **Credit Utilization Calculation:**
   ```
   Total Credit Card Balances ÷ Total Credit Limits × 100
   
   Example:
   Card 1: $2,000 / $10,000
   Card 2: $3,000 / $8,000
   Card 3: $500 / $5,000
   Total: $5,500 / $23,000 = 23.9% (Good)
   
   Guidelines:
   <30% = Excellent
   30-50% = Acceptable
   >50% = Concern
   >75% = High Risk
   ```

5. **Document Findings:**
   - Screenshot credit summary page
   - Note all derogatory items
   - Calculate average account age

### Step 3: Income and Employment Verification (15-20 minutes)

**Detailed Verification Steps:**

1. **Employment Verification Phone Call:**
   - Call HR department (not supervisor)
   - Use verbal VOE script:
     ```
     "This is [Name] from [Bank] calling to verify employment
     for [Applicant] who has applied for a mortgage loan.
     Can you verify:
     - Start date: _______
     - Current position: _______
     - Current salary: $_______
     - Employment status: FT/PT/Contract
     - Likelihood of continued employment: _______"
     ```
   - Document call details in system

2. **Income Calculation Worksheet:**
   ```
   Base Income Calculation:
   Latest Pay Stub Gross: $_______ × Pay Frequency = Annual
   Prior Year W-2: $_______
   2 Years Ago W-2: $_______
   
   If variance >10%, use:
   - Increasing: Current rate
   - Decreasing: Lower of current or average
   - Stable: 2-year average
   ```

3. **YTD Verification:**
   ```
   YTD Earnings ÷ # of Pay Periods = Average per Period
   Average × Annual Periods = Projected Annual
   
   Compare to stated income - variance must be <10%
   ```

   | SFR | 95% | None |
   | Condo | 90% | HOA review required |
   | 2-4 Unit | 85% | Rental income analysis |
   | Manufactured | 80% | Must be affixed |

### Step 5: Risk Assessment (10 minutes)

**Risk Scoring Matrix:**

| Factor | Low Risk (1) | Medium Risk (2) | High Risk (3) |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Credit Score | >720 | 660-719 | <660 |
| DTI | <30% | 30-40% | >40% |
| LTV | <70% | 70-85% | >85% |
| Employment | >5 years | 2-5 years | <2 years |
| Reserves | >12 months | 3-12 months | <3 months |
| Property | Primary | Second Home | Investment |

**Calculation:**
- Sum all scores
- 6-8 = Low Risk
- 9-12 = Medium Risk
- 13-18 = High Risk

### Step 6: Decision Formulation (10-15 minutes)

**Decision Tree Process:**

1. **Check Minimum Requirements:**
   ```
   Credit Score >= 620? → Yes/No
   DTI <= 50%? → Yes/No
   LTV <= 95%? → Yes/No
   Income Verified? → Yes/No
   
   If ANY "No" → DENY
   ```

2. **Apply Compensating Factors:**
   - Strong factors (can offset 1 weakness):
     - Assets > 20% of loan amount
     - Credit score > 780
     - LTV < 60%
   - Moderate factors (2 required to offset 1 weakness):
     - Stable employment > 10 years
     - No debt besides mortgage
     - Cash reserves > 12 months

3. **Determine Final Decision:**
   - All criteria met → APPROVE
   - 1-2 criteria missed but offset → CONDITIONAL
   - Multiple criteria missed → DENY
