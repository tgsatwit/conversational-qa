## Product Requirements Document (PRD): Conversational QA Prototype (Voice Modality)

### Product Vision

Enable reflective quality assurance through a voice-first coaching experience. This prototype demonstrates a novel post-process QA tool that speaks with an operator, helping them surface judgment gaps, clarify assumptions, and strengthen reasoning through real-time spoken dialogue. It’s not a chatbot, and it’s not a checklist. It’s a natural conversation that simulates a high-quality QA coaching interaction.

### Core Concept

Traditional QA methods rely on text annotations or rule-based reviews, which limit engagement and insight. In contrast, this prototype uses **voice-to-voice conversation** as the medium, where an AI coach listens, responds, and guides the operator through reasoning reflection.

This system aims to:

* Replace static form QA with conversational debriefs
* Use speech to surface implicit assumptions and flawed logic
* Provide psychologically safe, human-like audio feedback
* Help the operator improve their judgment and clarity over time

---

### Objectives & Success Metrics

**Objectives:**

* Demonstrate the feasibility and value of a voice-based QA model
* Show how post-process speech conversation improves reasoning visibility
* Highlight the prototype’s technical foundation for future productization

**Success Metrics:**

* ≥ 80% of participants say the voice experience made them think more deeply than written feedback
* ≥ 3 coaching questions generated per session
* ≥ 60% of seeded judgment flaws are detected through conversational probing
* Latency from voice input to voice reply < 7 seconds average

---

### Prototype Scope

This version is designed to test and showcase the core experience:

* One SOP-based workflow (Loan Approval)
* Structured form for operator decisions
* Single-trigger voice-based QA session
* One AI voice asking 2–4 follow-up coaching questions
* Operator responds via browser mic (voice-to-voice loop)

---

### User Journey

1. Operator completes a simulated SOP task.
2. Operator clicks "Start QA Conversation."
3. The AI voice asks a reflection question based on their decisions.
4. The operator responds verbally (recorded and transcribed).
5. The AI continues for 1–2 more turns.
6. Operator ends session with audio + text summary transcript.

---

### Differentiation: Why Voice?

* **Faster cognitive access**: Speaking is more fluid than writing.
* **More natural correction**: Spoken follow-ups can gently prompt reflection without feeling critical.
* **Greater psychological safety**: Encouraging tone, vocal nuance.
* **Deeper signal**: Voice reveals hesitation, confidence, and structure of thought.

---

### Target Users

* QA leads in financial operations and compliance
* Process coaches or team leaders responsible for training
* Designers of SOPs and risk controls who want to test decision complexity

---

### Functional Requirements (Aligned to Tech Spec)

* Display SOP in frontend and collect operator input
* Generate a conversational QA prompt dynamically from that input
* Use:

  * OpenAI Whisper or equivalent for STT
  * GPT-4 for reasoning + reflection prompts
  * ElevenLabs (or similar) for realistic TTS voice feedback
* Play response via browser
* Capture voice response and repeat for 2–3 coaching turns

---

### Constraints & Assumptions

* Operator completes process before QA begins (post-process)
* AI tone must feel natural and non-robotic
* Conversations are short (1–2 minutes total)
* Network latency should not exceed 7 seconds per exchange

---

### Future Considerations

* Real-time voice coaching during tasks (in-process QA)
* Longitudinal tracking of operator reasoning patterns
* AI coach personalization (tone, pace, language preference)
* Integration with LMS systems for training outcomes

---

### Summary

This prototype introduces a new modality to QA: **voice-based reflective coaching.** It leverages AI to simulate how the best QA leads probe, clarify, and reinforce good thinking—only now, it’s instant and scalable. The goal isn’t just compliance. It’s clarity, accountability, and better reasoning, powered by conversation.
